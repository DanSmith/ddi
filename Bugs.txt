Bugs for Revision to 2-17 CR3 Release
_____________________________________

* means a change must be made, but hasn't yet.

Bug 75: Documentation only (no change made)
Bug 137: Documentation for arrayOrder attribute in measureReference (in NCube) does not tell the user how to populate the field - please improve this!

Further: Instruction under NCube which make no sense (they refer to fields which aren't there):

REMOVE /DataItem/MeasureValue/@decimalSeparator
REMOVE /DataItem/MeasureValue/@groupingSeparator
REMOVE /DataItem/MeasureValue/@type
CHANGE /DataItem/MeasureValue/@xml:lang FROM 1..1 TO 0..1

These are only on dataitem in all three NCube layouts. I have made xml:lang optional in all cases. Should the other attributes be deleted???????

For TopLeftTableAnchorType in Tabular_NCube, I made the values of the @row and @column xs:integer instead of xs:string.


For tabular_NCube, the value of the Row sub-element in PhysicalTableLocation has been made an integer instead of a string. Is this correct? (What would the string be? A column heading? The documentation does not specify, so I assume it is a number. But what is the base? The documentation is not sufficient here!)








Bug 127: Deleted elementsd/types as required.
Bug 98/96: Changes as per Mantis, except that an attribute has become an element because a controlled vocabulary takes a complex content.
Bug 63: Documentation only.
Bug 142: Documentation only.
Bug 150: Change as indicated.
Bug 106: Changed as per bug, but ignored the bit about "ClassificationLevelCode xs:string
restrictions:" as this didn't seem to belong. Ask Wendy to check.
Bug 141: Made changes as requested in bug, but made NCubesInRecord optional because it doesn't apply to non-NCube Record Layouts.
Bug 143: made changes as per action, but had to move ProprietaryProperty and ProprietaryInfo types and element declarations into reusable, since they were only in a beta module which by definition cannot be imported into a final module (!)
Bug 144: Made changes as per bug, but disagree with removal of container DataItems - this was a better-encapsulated solution IMO.
Bug 145: Made changes as per Mantis.
Bug 146: Changes made as per Mantis.
Bug 147: Changes made as per Mantis.
Bug 132: Changes made as per Mantis.
Bug 20: No action needed.
Bug 130/131: No action taken.
Bug 123: Change made as per bug - nested "Difference" has been removed. Should MapType be a string? This could either be a term from a controlled vocabulary or an InternationalString (and thus repeatable). Discuss and decide.
Bug 125: Made changes as suggested, with minor differences (r:Description cannot be referenced directly as a type, and must be repeatable as it can exist in several languages). Also, the maps themselves have become versionable, not maintainable (!).
Bug 128: Made changes as per Mantis.
Bug 111: No action required (subsumed in other bug).
Bug 114: No action required (subsumed in other bug).
Bug 112: No action needed.
*Bug 120: Not yet fixed !!!!
Bug 124: Changes made as per Mantis.
Bug 122: No action taken pending discussion.
Bug 126: Changes as per mantis, but added a required record reference on the values of a variable set.
*Bug 107: No action taken!!! (Pending discussion).
Bug 113: Changes made as per Mantis, except we used "unbounded" instead of "unlimited" because it parses better ;-)
Bug 115: As for 113. Should we make the same change in PhysicalInstance in VariableStatisticType?
*Bug 119: No action yet taken!!!!
Bug 117: Action taken as per Mantis, but provided a default value of "false" to clear up ambiguity if unspecified..
